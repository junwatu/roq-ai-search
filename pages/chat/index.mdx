The chat system uses a secure websocket socket connection to send and receive realtime messages. It can be integrated
into your application within a few minutes and customized to your requirements. It is highly flexible, and using a
combination of the customizable UI widgets for chat and the API; you could achieve a wide range of flexibility - from a
private messenger-like experience to even a slack-like experience.

* Conversations among multiple users
* Rich-text editor for messages
