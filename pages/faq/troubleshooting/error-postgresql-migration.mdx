# Error Migration on PostgreSQL  

Prisma migration failed on PostgreSQL, the error message on the command line:

<Callout type="error">
ERROR: function `uuid_generate_v4()` does not exist
</Callout>

![error postgresql migration](/migrate-error-postgresql.png)


## Solution

<Callout type="info">
The error occurred specifically in the older version of the application that was generated. However, the problem with the UUID extension has been fixed in the newer version. If you encounter this error, please refer to the solution provided below.
</Callout>

Enable the **uuid-ossp** module in PostgreSQL. One way to do this is by enabling manually via administration tool, such as [**pgAdmin**](https://www.pgadmin.org/).

To enable the **uuid-ossp** on PostgreSQL, run this SQL script:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"
```

![enable uuid postgresql](/enable-uuid-postgresql.png)

After that go back to the generated application root project and re-run the migration again:

```shell
npx prisma generate
```

and deploy again to the PostgreSQL database:

```shell
npx prisma migrate deploy
```
