# How to Post Login Redirect

The post-login redirect works by passing a URL as a query parameter to the `signIn` or `signUp` method. Once the user is logged in successfully, they will be redirected to that URL.

The use case for this is when we browse to a specific application page and are automatically logged out due to inactivity. When we log back in, the application page is not in its previous state.

## `postLoginRedirect`

The `postLoginRedirect` is a state parameter option for the `signIn` and `signUp` methods in the `@roq/nextjs` package. With this option set, any login will redirect to the path URL.

For example, In the generated application, to redirect the URL to `/discussion-boards` after user login, you can pass the path URL into the `signIn` method:

```js
signIn(type, {
        postLoginRedirect: "/discussion-boards",
    },
})
```

The ROQ login component will include state parameters in its URL:

```shell
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login?postLoginRedirect=%2Fdiscussion-boards&variantKey=store-owner
```
The URL above tell us that this login form, after successful authentication, will redirect the user to the discussion boards page.
