# Multi-Factor Authentication

ROQ provides an additional layer of protection, which is **Multi-Factor Authentication** or called **MFA**. With this security enhancement, you can use your phone number as additional application authentication.

### Enable MFA for Users

To activate Multi-factor Authentication for users, you need to turn on the MFA option in the ROQ Console. Navigate to the **Users & Access** → **Users** section and choose the specific users you wish to enable MFA for.

There are two settings that require attention:

- **Phone**: Enter your phone number, which will be used to send the verification code.
- **Two-factor Authentication**: Enable this option to apply MFA to the selected user.

3. Enable Two-factor Authentication on Registration Form Variant in the ROQ Console.
4. The existing users (with MFA enabled) will be forced to enter a verification code in the login form.
5. Users with successful verification for the first time will get the recovery codes, which can be saved through manual copy-paste or downloading the recovery-codes.txt file.
6. When the same user login again, the app will send a verification code to the user's phone to verify the login attempt.
7. If the Two-factor authentication is disabled in the ROG Console authentication configuration. The users will not force to verify the login even though the user is enabled for MFA in the ROQ Console.
