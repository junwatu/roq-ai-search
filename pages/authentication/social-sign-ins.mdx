## Google

To enable Google OAuth login follow this [documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en). For most of social sign-ins you need to setup these two credentials:

* **Client ID**: Client ID for Web application

* **Client Secret**: Client Secret for Web application

The `Auth Redirect URI` is needed to be setup on the Google's `Authorized redirect URIs` setting page.

Once activated the Google Signin is ready to be used as a registration or login option.
