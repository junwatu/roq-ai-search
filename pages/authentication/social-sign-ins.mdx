# Social sign-ins

ROQ supports various social sign-ins like Google, Facebook, Github, LinkedIn. You can activate and configure them in ROQ Console and go to `Authentication` âž” `Social Sign-in` or [here](https://console.roq.tech/settings/authentication-form/social-signin).

## Google

To enable Google OAuth login, follow this [documentation](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en). For most social sign-ins, you need to set up these two credentials:

* **Client ID**: Client ID for Web application

* **Client Secret**: Client Secret for Web application

And for the `Auth Redirect URI`, it is needed to be setup on the Google's `Authorized redirect URIs` setting page.

Once activated, Google Sign-in is ready to be used as a registration or login option.
