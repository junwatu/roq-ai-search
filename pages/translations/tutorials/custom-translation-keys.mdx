# Customize Translation Keys

## Add Translation Keys

Adding a translation key is very easy, in the ROQ Console, go to the **Keys** menu and then click the **+ Create key** button. You should fill in the **Key** and the **Translate Default Locale** values.

For instance, create a new translation key `roq-ui.auth.input.country.region` with the translate locale value is `Region.`

After the translation key is created, the new key will be placed on the first row of the translation keys list hence it will be easier to find. The new key will be available for all other locales, which means you can translate this key value to other languages.

The translation key is unique so you cannot add the same key.

## Edit Translations Keys

You can edit the translation by using the **Controls** edit button on the list. Within this translation editor, you can also edit the translation for another language, such as `German, Germany (de-DE)`, etc.

To check the status of a specific translated language, you can choose the locale from the **Select Locale** dropdown and then sort it by **Status**. 

For example, to sort untranslated keys for the `German, Germany (de-DE)` language, you can select **Untranslated** status.

Changes will be shown in the UI components after a few minutes because of the browser's caching system.

### Delete Translations Keys

Deleting translation keys is not recommended. We do not know if the keys are used or not by the application code hence it will have a runtime effect on the application but if you must delete a key then make sure the key is not being used in the application.

To delete a translation key, click the **Trash** icon from the **Available Keys** list.
