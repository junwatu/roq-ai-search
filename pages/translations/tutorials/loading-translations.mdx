# How to Loading Translations in Code

Locales are defined as a prop of `<RoqProvider>`. If no locale is defined, then `en-US` will be used as the default
locale.

```tsx copy
<RoqProvider locale="de-DE">
  <Component />
</RoqProvider>
```

The `<RoqProvider>` fetches translations from ROQ Platform every five minutes. The data is cached in the user's browser.
