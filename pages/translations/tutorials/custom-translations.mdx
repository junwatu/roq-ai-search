# How to Create Custom Translations

Translation customization can be done by edit the translation key, add or remove keys and add or remove locales.

## Translations

Managing translations can be done in `Translations` section of ROQ console or directly go [here](https://console.roq.tech/localization/translations) if you are already logged in. The default translation for the generated application is in English (en-US) language.

You can edit the translation by using `Controls` edit button. Within this translation editor, you can also edit the translation for another language, such as for German (de-DE), etc.

To check the status of a specific translated language, you can choose the locale from the `Select Locale` dropdown and then sort it by `Status`. For example, to sort untranslated keys for the German (de-DE) language, you can select `Untranslated` status.

Changes will be shown in the UI components after a few minutes because of the browser's caching system.

## Translation Keys

Adding translation key is easy, go to the `Keys` menu and then click the `+ Create key` button.

After the translation key is created, it will be available for all the locales and by default it will be placed on the first row of the translation list.
