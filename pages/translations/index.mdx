# Custom Translations

## Introduction

The B2B SaaS application generated by ROQ can be translated into any language. The translated texts can be managed via [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech).

## Managing Translations

Managing translations can be done in `Translations` section of ROQ console or directly go [here](https://console.roq.tech/localization/translations) if you are already logged in.

The default translation for the generated application is in English (en-US) language.

You can edit the translation by using `Controls` edit button. Within this translation editor, you can also edit the translation for another language, such as for German (de-DE), etc.

To check the status of a specific translated language, you can choose the locale from the `Select Locale` dropdown and then sort it by `Status`. For example, to sort untranslated keys for the German (de-DE) language, you can select `Untranslated` status.

Changes will be shown in the UI components after a few minutes because of the browser's caching system.

## Managing Translation Keys

Adding translation key is easy, go to the `Keys` menu and then click the `+ Create key` button.

After the translation key is created, it will be available for all the locales and by default it will be placed on the first row of the translation list.

The translation key is unique so you cannot add the same key.

## Managing Locales

To manage locales, go to the `Locales` menu and to add a new locale, click the `+ Add Locale` button. For example to add application support for Arabic (ar-SA) locale

You can also set the default locale to be used for the generated application by checkmark `Set As Default`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
You cannot remove a locale as long as there are translated texts using this locale.
</Callout>

## Technical integration

The current locale needs to be set to the `<RoqProvider/>` wrapper as
described [here](/translations/custom-translations#loading-translations-in-code). In case you want to use your existing 
translation
system, please refer to the [custom translation](/translations/custom-translations) section.
