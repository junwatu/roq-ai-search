# Activate Multi-Tenancy

The generated application has the multi-tenancy feature enabled by default, and the default multi-tenancy name is **Organization**.

You can rename the default multi-tenancy by modifying the **Set name for your tenants** field according to your business requirements. For example, a multi-tenancy called **AntWorld** can have several tenants, such as **AntSpec**, **AntVideos**, and **Organization**.

## How To Add A Tenant

To introduce a new tenant into your organization, you need to create a new tenant account.

By default, selecting Create Account on the application homepage will register a new tenant (organization). You can name this tenant anything that aligns with your business needs. For example add **Ant Discussion**, a place for a community discussion.

If you navigate to the Users & Access section in the ROQ Console, you will see the newly added tenant, Ant Discussion, in the tenant list.
