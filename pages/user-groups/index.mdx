# User Groups

## Introduction

We usually interpret a user group as precisely what the name says: _“a group of users”_. For example, you may want to group users by their home country or any other characteristic.

User groups are used for [notifications](/notifications). Instead of listing all users, you can set one or multiple groups of users.

## Manage User Groups

You can manage user groups via [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) or [`createUserGroup()`](/user-groups/api#createusergroup) API. A user group has a **name** (e.g. _“The Mavericks”_ or _“The Gourmet Kitchen”_). In addition, you can define a project-specific **reference** that enables you to fetch user groups using your identifier.

## Add and Remove Users

You can add and remove users from a user group in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) or use the [`addUsersToUserGroup()`](/user-groups/api#adduserstousergroup) API. Group memberships are also shown for each user in the console.

## API

You can access information about the User Groups API by clicking on this [link](/user-groups/api).

## Tutorials

The tutorials section includes guides on sending emails and notifications to user groups. The [send email to groups](/user-groups/tutorials/send-email-to-groups) tutorial explains selecting a group and using the relevant API. The [send notification to user groups](/user-groups/tutorials/notify-user-groups) tutorial teaches how to send notifications to a user group via the Notification API.
