# User Invites

## Introduction

In B2B SaaS applications, it is common for users to invite others from their organization, also known as "tenants", especially when there is a charge for each user. ROQ offers a comprehensive user invite solution that can be used in conjunction with authentication.

## How It Works

### User Invites

By integrating the `<UserInvitesTable />` UI component, you enable users to invite others. The invitee receives an email with a link to accept the invite. In B2B scenarios, the invited users join the same organization or **tenant** as the inviting user.

### Role of The Invited User

The inviting user can define the role of the invitee. For instance, the new user can be invited as a **Member** or **Manager**. This behavior is fully customizable in the ROQ Console.

## UI Components

ROQâ€™s user invite provides multiple UI components which can be integrated into your application:

1. The [**`<UserInvitesTable/>`**](/user-invites/ui-components#userinvitestable-) is an
   advanced component that handles the entire logic at once.
2. The [**`<UserInvitePane/>`**](/user-invites/ui-components#userinvitepane-) is a pane that allows to invite one or multiple users at once.
3. The [**`<UserInviteButton/>`**](/user-invites/ui-components#userinvitebutton-) is a user invite button which opens a lightbox.

## API

ROQ also provide integration using API. Check out the User Invite API documentation [here](/user-invites/api).
