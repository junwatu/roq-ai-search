# How to Add a New Notification

Establishing notifications is a crucial aspect of any successful software application. Notifications engage users and keep them informed about important updates, events, or required actions. With the ROQ platform, you can add a new notification to your project through a straightforward process.

This guide will walk you through the steps needed to add a new notification to your project using ROQ's user interface.

## Selecting the Project

Begin by selecting the specific project and environment on the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) for which you want to create a new notification. Make sure to choose the appropriate **project** and **environment** before proceeding.

## Accessing the Notifications Settings Page

To access the notifications settings page in the ROQ console, click the Notifications menu (represented by a bell icon). On this page, you will see a list of notification templates for the current project.

## Creating a New Notification Template

To create a new notification template, click the **Templates** menu, then locate and click the **Create Template** button. This action will initiate the process of creating a new notification template, enabling you to customize the notification according to your project's needs.

When creating a new notification template, you need to fill in two fields:

1. **Key**: Each template requires a unique key, which will be used as a reference to trigger notifications using the API or programmatically.
2. **Notification Description**: This is where you describe the notification.

After creating a notification template, you will need to configure and activate the channels. Currently, we support three channels: Web (In-App), Email, and SMS.

Each of these channels allows you to configure message templates.

Please note that for the **Email** and **SMS** channels to work, you need to set up ROQ with third-party services first in the [Integration](/mails/integration) ROQ Console.

To create localized content for the channel messages, click **Create Localized Content** button. Fill in the fields to your needs and save it.

The localized content supports custom variables, enabling you to notify users with custom values in the message.

You can set the `downloadLink` variable with Notification API or by query via GraphQL API. For instance, using Node.js and GraphQL:

<Tabs items={['Node.js SDK', 'GraphQL']}>
<Tab>
```ts
await client.asSuperAdmin().notify({
  notification: {
    key: 'notification_key_template_here',
    recipients: {
      userIds: ['abc123'],
      userGroups: { operator: 'AND', userGroupIds: ['xyz789'] },
      excludedUserIds: ['abc123'],
      allUsers: false,
    },
    data: [{ key: 'downloadLink', value: 'https://youtubiah-8b47.vercel.app/file/youfile.zip' }],
  },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```graphql
mutation {
  notify(
    notification: {
      key: "notification_key_template_here"
      recipients: {
        userIds: ["abc123"]
        userGroups: { operator: AND, userGroupIds: ["xyz789"] }
        excludedUserIds: ["abc123"]
        allUsers: false
      }
      data: [{ key: "downloadLink", value: "https://youtubiah-8b47.vercel.app/file/youfile.zip" }]
    }
  ) {
    usersNotified {
      count
    }
  }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

After **Create Localized Content** for any channels that you need, the notification will show up on **Notifications Preferences** in your SaaS project.
