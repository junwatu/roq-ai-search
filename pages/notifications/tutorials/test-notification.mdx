# Test Notifications

To test the notifications we created earlier we need to query data from the GraphQL server. The URL for  this GraphQL server is in **Project Details** in the ROQ console.

This page shows all the credentials to access the GraphQL server.

To test or trigger the notifications, we can use a GraphQL query like this:

```graphql
mutation {
  notify(
    notification: {
      key: "translated-file-conversion"
      recipients: {
        userIds: ["163ae909-b611-423c-b105-67f86a8870ac"]
        userGroups: { operator: AND, userGroupIds: ["325a3bc5-3d65-4868-b4af-85d4f8f206b8"] }
        allUsers: false
      },
      data: [{ key: 'downloadLink', value: 'https://roq.ai' }]
    }
  ) {
    usersNotified {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

If you execute the GraphQL query above in the GraphQL API server sandbox, you will get 1 user notified.

and the triggered notifications will show to any recipients.
