# Test Notifications

To test the notifications we created earlier we need to query data from the GraphQL server. The URL for  this GraphQL server is in **Project Details** in the ROQ console.

<Callout type="info">
Make sure the environment where you get all the credentials is the same as the environment you have added the notification.
</Callout>

This page shows all the credentials to access the GraphQL server.

![Project details for graphql api](/project-details-graphql-api-url.png)

To test or trigger the notifications, we can use a GraphQL query like this:


```graphql
mutation {
  notify(
    notification: {
      key: "translated-file-conversion"
      recipients: {
        userIds: ["163ae909-b611-423c-b105-67f86a8870ac"]
        userGroups: { operator: AND, userGroupIds: ["325a3bc5-3d65-4868-b4af-85d4f8f206b8"] }
        allUsers: false
      },
      data: [{ key: 'downloadLink', value: 'https://youtubiah-8b47.vercel.app/file/youfile.zip' }]
    }
  ) {
    usersNotified {
      count
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
To determine a user ID, you currently need to extract it from the last segment of the user URL. Follow the steps below to do this:

1. Navigate to the ROQ console.
2. From the menu, select **Users & Access** and then **Users**.
3. Locate and select the email of the user whose ID you wish to identify.
4. Click the **Edit User** button (denoted by a pen icon).
   
As you perform these actions, note that the URL will change. Here's an example:

```
https://console.roq.tech/.../users/1efad280-45bd-49c5-8125-598ea622b925
```

In this URL, the user ID is `1efad280-45bd-49c5-8125-598ea622b925`.
</Callout>

If you execute the GraphQL query above in the GraphQL API server sandbox, you will get 1 user notified.

and the triggered notifications will show to any recipients.

If you have configured notification for Email or SMS, you have to activate Email or SMS integration first. For how to configure email integration, please read [here](/mails/integration)
