# Notifications

## Introduction

ROQ's notification system allows you to reach your users or user groups through various channels:

* In-app notifications: These are loaded in real-time, using a socket connection directly from your web app.
* Traditional e-mails: Deliver messages straight to the users' inbox.
* SMS or push messages: Send notifications directly to your users' mobile phones.

Users can customize their preferences for each type of notification. For example, they can choose to receive alerts through push messages while getting product updates via e-mail or SMS.

## How to Add a New Notification

To add a new notification in the ROQ-generated application, check out the documentation [here](/notifications/tutorials/add-notifications).

## How to Trigger a Notification
