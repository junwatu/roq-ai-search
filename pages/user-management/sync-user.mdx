# Sync users

Before using ROQ‚Äôs feature, you need to synchronize some of your user data. This is needed for two reasons:

1. The user data needs to be present on ROQ Platform side so that user-specific JWT tokens can be created. These
   tokens are used for secure interaction between your application and ROQ.
2. The user data is also used to send emails and notifications. For instance, you may want to address your users by
   their first name in a notification template: Hi `{{recipient.firstName}}`

It‚Äôs your decision which information you wish to synchronize to ROQ. It‚Äôs recommended to send the data to ROQ after you
store it in your database using the [**`createUser()`**](/user-management/api#createuser) API:

```typescript
const roqUser = await client.asSuperAdmin().createUser({
    user: {
        reference: 'abc123',
        email: 'xyz789',
        firstName: 'xyz789',
        lastName: 'xyz789',
        isOptedIn: true,
        active: true,
        locale: "en-US",
    },
});
```
</Tab>
<Tab>

```graphql
mutation {
  createUser(
    user: {
      reference: "abc123"
      email: "xyz789"
      phone: "xyz789"
      firstName: "xyz789"
      lastName: "abc123"
      locale: "en-US"
      isOptedIn: false
      active: false
    }
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è It's important to save the returned ID on your side, so that you can use it for other features. To lean more about
the parameters, please refer to the [**`createUser()`**](/user-management/api#createuser) API documentation.
