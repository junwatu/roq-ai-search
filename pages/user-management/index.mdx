# User Management

## Introduction

ROQ provides a complete solution for user management. With ROQ, you can:

* Protect your web application with login and registration ([authentication](/authentication)).
* Group users into tenants ([multi-tenancy](/multi-tenancy)).
* Invite other users ([user invites](/user-invites)).
* Notify your users via various channels ([notifications](/notifications)).
* Define roles and permissions for users ([access management](/access-management)).
* Login to [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) and see all data which is related to a user.


{/*
# User sync

In case you want to keep your existing authentication system, then you need to synchronize some user data, which is
required by other features of ROQ. See instructions [here](/user-management/advanced/sync-user).
