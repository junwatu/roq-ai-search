# Edit Data Models

ROQ provides a database model or schema editor. It is designed so you can easily customize the generated application data model to meet your business needs. 

You can access the Data Model Editor feature in ROQ Console. Go to **Home** â†’ **Get Started** and find the **Step 3: Fine-tune your database model** section and click the **Edit Data Model** button.

## Add New Models

Let's take an example, to add a new model or new table into the database for a Library Management application. Suppose we want to add ISBN data model into the database, these are the typical neccessary steps:

<Steps>
### Add New Table

To add a new model (essentially the same with add a new table), click the **+ Add new table** button and then ROQ will provides a new table with the default fields and values.

### Add Fields

For our ISBN data model we can name the table **isbn** and then we can add **number** field to the model.

### Create Relationships

Generally a book will have one and only one ISBN. From this information we can specify the relationship between isbn and book is **One to One**.
