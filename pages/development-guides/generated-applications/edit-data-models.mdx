# Edit Data Models

## Introduction

ROQ provides a database model or schema editor sometime we call it **Data Model Editor**. It is designed so you can easily customize the generated application data model to meet your business needs. 

You can access the **Data Model Editor** feature in ROQ Console with a few ways:

### Onboarding Console Page

You can access the data model editor from the onboarding page. Go to **Home** → **Get Started** page and find the **Step 3: Fine-tune your database model** section and click the **Edit Data Model** button.

### Generated Application

You can access the data model editor in the generated application too. There is an `Edit data model` button in the top of the generated application.

## Data Model Editor

Using the Data Model Editor, you can **add models**, **add fields**, **create** and **edit relationships**.

## Modifying Models

Let's take an example, to add a new model or new table into the database for a Library Management application. Suppose we want to add ISBN data model into the database, these are the typical neccessary steps:

<Steps>
### Add New Models

To add a new model (essentially the same with add a new table), click the **+ Add new table** button and then ROQ will provides a new table with the default fields and values.

### Add Fields

For our ISBN data model we can name the table `isbn*` and then we can add `number` field to the model.

### Create Relationships

Generally a book will have one and only one ISBN. From this information we can specify the relationship between **book** and **isbn** is **One to One**.

You can add or edit the relationship with clicking the **Edit** relationships button and then select the options:

- **Select Related Model**: `book`
- **Model Relationships**: `One to One`
- **Foreign Key Name**: `isbn_id`

Save every changes with clicking the **Save** button.

</Steps>

## Applied New Models

To apply new models to the application, we need to  regenerate the application.

### Regenerate Application

You can do this by clicking the **Generate Application** button and then ROQ will regenerate the application with the new models applied.

This regeneration process will create a new application version, yes now you have two application versions, and you can select the application version from the **Environment** → **Projects** menu.
