# Edit Data Models

ROQ provides a database model or schema editor. It is designed so you can easily customize the generated application data model to meet your business needs. 

You can access the Data Model Editor feature in ROQ Console. Go to **Home** → **Get Started** and find the **Step 3: Fine-tune your database model** section and click the **Edit Data Model** button.

## Modifying Models

Let's take an example, to add a new model or new table into the database for a Library Management application. Suppose we want to add ISBN data model into the database, these are the typical neccessary steps:

<Steps>
### Add New Models

To add a new model (essentially the same with add a new table), click the **+ Add new table** button and then ROQ will provides a new table with the default fields and values.

### Add Fields

For our ISBN data model we can name the table `isbn*` and then we can add `number` field to the model.

### Create Relationships

Generally a book will have one and only one ISBN. From this information we can specify the relationship between **book** and **isbn** is **One to One**.

You can add or edit the relationship with clicking the **Edit** relationships button and then select the options:

- **Select Related Model**: `book`
- **Model Relationships**: `One to One`
- **Foreign Key Name**: `isbn_id`

Save every changes with clicking the **Save** button.

</Steps>

## Applied New Models

To apply new models to the application, we need to  regenerate the application.

### Regenerate Application

You can do this by clicking the **Generate Application** button and then ROQ will regenerate the application with the new models applied.

This regeneration process will create a new application version, yes now you have two application versions, and you can select the application version from the **Environment** → **Projects** menu.
