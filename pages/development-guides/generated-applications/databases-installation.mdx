# Database Installation

ROQ already provides a managed database even for local development purposes. The default database that ROQ provides is PostgreSQL. You can use this database or setup your own locally. 

<Callout type="info">
The database URL is set in the environment variable `DATABASE_URL`. You will find the database variable and other required environment variables on the ROQ Console **Get Started** page.
</Callout>

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

To install PostgreSQL in your operating system please follow the steps bellow:

You can easily install PostgreSQL manually through Windows installer. These are general steps to install it:
<Steps>

### Download Installer

Download the PostgreSQL installer for Windows from a certified [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) website. The Windows installer only supports 64-bit systems, and we will use PostgreSQL 15 version in this documentation.

### Run Installation

The installation for Windows is pretty straight forward process, just click the installer and follow the installation next process.

![postgres install start](/postgresql-install-1.png)

Leave every options as default, what you need to be aware of is you have to set the database password because you will need it later.

![set postgres password](/postgresql-install-password.png)

The default PostgreSQL port installation is at **5432**, with the username and password will be used to form the database URL set in the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. 

For example, with the default username is `postgres`, the database name is `mydatabase`, running on local host and the password is `mypassword`, we can form the database URL as:

```shell
postgresql://postgres:mypassword@localhost:5432/mydatabase
```

### Run pgAdmin

You can check the PostgreSQL installation with `psql` CLI tool or with **pgAdmin** GUI tool on Windows.
