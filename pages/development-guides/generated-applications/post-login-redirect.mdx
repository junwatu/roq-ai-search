# Post Login Redirect

The post login redirect works by passing a URL as a query parameter to the `signIn` or `signUp` method. Once the user is logged in successfully, they will be redirected to that URL.ey are then redirected to that URL.

```js
signIn(type, {stateParams: {
	postLoginRedirect: redirectPath,
	},
})
```

For example to redirect the URL to `/figure-inventories` you can pass the URL into the `signIn` method:

```js
signIn(type, {stateParams: {
	postLoginRedirect: "/figure-inventories",
	},
})
```
