# Generated Application Development

After succesfully generate application using ROQ's AI Assistant the next step it to begin development such as adding features, doing improvement, etc.  

## Software Requirements

### Git Version Control

The generated application code is reside in the GitHub public repository and to begin a local development you need a version control software called [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

<Callout type="info">
The default name for your GitHub repository is the same name with the subdomain of  the generated application deployed on Vercel. For instance, the deployed application URL is `https://bistro-94be.vercel.app` then the name of the GitHub repository is `bistro-94be`. 

You can search your repository in the ROQ's public GitHub repositories [here](/https://github.com/roq-ai-snapshot).
</Callout>

You can check if git is already installed in your system by execute this command to the terminal:

```sh
git version
```

If it already installed then you will get the git version response and you are good to go to the next step, which is clone your generated application code. If the git is not installed, just read and follow the [git documentation website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

### Node.js

The application generated by ROQ AI Assistant is Node.js based project. At least you need [Node.js 16.8](https://nodejs.org/) version installed in your system. 

<Callout type="info">
Look into this [documentation](/getting-started/technology-stack) about the technology stack used by ROQ.
</Callout>

To check if Node.js is installed in your system, type this command in the terminal:

```sh
node --version
```
 if Node.js already installed  the go to the next step, which is clone the generated application repository. 

## Clone the Repository

Clone the repository means copy the remote repository code into your local environment. To clone the generated application code from GitHub public repository, for instance the reposity name is `bistro-94be`.

<Callout type="info">
Before clone the repo, you need the repository URL from GitHub. Go to the generated application code repository `https://github.com/roq-ai-snapshot/bistro-94be` then copy the **HTTPS** clone repository URL.

You can also download the zip file version but for this tutorial purpose we don't do that way.
</Callout>


```sh
git clone https://github.com/roq-ai-snapshot/bistro-94be.git
```

After cloned the repository, change the terminal directory to the application project repository and install all the dependencies using `npm`:

```sh
cd bistro-94be

npm install
```

<Callout type="info">
`npm` is a node package manager and it's bundled with the Node.js installation. You don't need extra steps to install it.
</Callout>

### Remove Origin

<Callout type="info">
Why removing the origin? The ROQ public repository doesn't allow write permission. The other option other than forking and then make a pull request, is to "move" the generated application code in our own repository.
</Callout>

An origin in git is actually an alias for the remote repository URL  that we already cloned (that's it: `https://github.com/roq-ai-snapshot/bistro-94be.git`). To remove an origin from your Git repository, you can use the `git remote` command with the remove option. Here's the syntax:

```bash
git remote remove origin
```

This command will remove the link between your local repository and the origin remote repository. It will not delete any data. You can later add a new origin or re-link to the original origin using git remote add origin.

You can verify that the origin was removed correctly by typing:

```bash
git remote -v
```

This command should now return no output, indicating that there are no remotes connected to your local Git repository.
