# Application Deployment

There are so many application hosting services. The generated application is Node.js and Next.js based, so as long as the hosting service support that then it will be ok. 

For this documentation, we will use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). 

## Vercel

There are a few steps that should be done before deploying our generated application into Vercel.

<Steps>
### Create Vercel Account

Creating a Vercel account is a straightforward process. Go to [https://vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup). You can choose **Hobby** or **Pro** and name the project whatever you need.

Vercel will try to connect the new account with git providers or you can use the email instead. You can use any git provider, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and for this documentation, we will use GitHub.

### Import A Project

To import a project, click the **Add New...** â†’ **Project**. This will bring you into importing a project from GitHub.
