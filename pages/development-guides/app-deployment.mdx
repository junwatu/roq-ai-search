# Application Deployment

There are so many application hosting service. The generated application is Node.js and Next.js based, so as long as the hosting service support that then it will be ok. 

For this documentation we will use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). 

## Vercel

There are a few steps tha should be done before deploying our generated application into Vercel.

Vercel wil try to connect the new account with git providers or you can use the email instead. You can use any git providers, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket and for this documentation we will use GitHub.
