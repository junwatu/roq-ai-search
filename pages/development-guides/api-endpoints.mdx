# API Endpoints

The ROQ's generated B2B SaaS application is based on [Next.js]() from Vercel so it is easy to develop, adding more features, API endpoints, custom styling, etc. 


<Callout type="info">
To continue development, you should fork or clone the source code of the generated application. Read this [documentation](/getting-started).

## How To Add API Endpoint

The generated application uses API endpoints in `pages/api` directory. These APIs are the bridges between the UI components, ROQ platform and other third party services.

To add API endpoint is easy, you can do so by creating a function inside `pages/api` directory that has the following format:

```ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';

// TypeScript
export async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
	//...do your business with this route here
}
```

in the generated application if you need API endpoint with authentication you can secure the handler with `withAuth()` function.

```ts
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next';
import { withAuth, getServerSession } from '@roq/nextjs';

// TypeScript
async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
	//...do your business with this route here
}

export default function filesHandler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
  return withAuth(req, res)(handler);
}
```
