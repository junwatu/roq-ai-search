# File Management

## Introduction

ROQ provides a complete solution for file management, including these features:

* File upload using the UI component
* Files visiblity (public or private)
* File associations (files can be related to any object)
 

## UI Components

ROQ’s file management provides multiple UI components which can be integrated into your application:

1. The [**`<FileUpload/>`**](/files/ui-components#fileupload) component represents a button which opens a file selector and
   starts uploads.
2. The [**`<FileDropzone/>`**](/files/ui-components#filedropzone) UI component represents an area on your application
   where users can drag and drop files to be uploaded.
3. The [**`<FileActiveUploads/>`**](/files/ui-components#fileactiveuploads) component shows a progress bar of all active files
   uploads.

## Basic concepts

### File Uploads

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Files that are uploaded to ROQ Platform are stored on [Scaleway Object Storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/object-storage/). The data center is located in Paris. 
</Callout>

Files can be uploaded via [File Upload UI component](/files/ui-components#fileupload) or programmatically using the
[createFileUpload() API](/files/api#createfileupload). The upload is realized using signed URLs, which means the
files are uploaded directly from the user's browser to the object storage without sending it through your backend.

### File Categories

File categories can be managed via [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/) only. 

They have two purposes:
* Enable filtering by categories, see [files()](/files/api#files) API
* Add validators to categories (see next section)

### Upload Validations

ROQ is using file categories to define rules for the upload in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/). For
instance, you can set a category called _"pictures"_ which requires the mime type of the uploaded file to be an image
(see [image mime type](https://mimetype.io/all-types/#image)). You can also restrict the maximum size of uploads.

### File Visibility

A file can be either **public** or **private**. Public means that there is a permanent URL which can be used by anyone,
while private files can only be accessed by user who are allowed to do so. The visibility of a file can be changed in
ROQ Console or via [makeFilePublic()](/files/api#makefilepublic) / [makeFilePrivate()](/files/api#makefileprivate) APIs

### Access Management

You can define permissions of files using ROQ's [access management feature](/access-management). Files
are always owned by the user who uploaded it. You can restrict the access to this user or enable users of the same
tenant to download the file.

### File Associations

When a file is stored on ROQ Platform, then it usually belongs to another object. For instance PDF files can be uploaded
and related to a _"contract"_.

### File Categories

Additionally, you can also configure categories in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/)
