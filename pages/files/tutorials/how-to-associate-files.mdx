# How to Associate Files

The purpose of file associations is to link files with entities, simplifying the database schema.

Let's take an example of file associations for discussion attachments on inventory. When users discuss particular figures on the discussion board, they might upload photos relevant to the figure inventory.

## Get Entities

Before creating any file associations, we need to get the entities. We need the entity's name and references to connect or associate the file.

### GraphQL API Sandbox

There are many ways to get entities in the ROQ platform. One of the ways is to use the [`projectEntities()`](https://jupiter-pp.roq-platform.com/docs/#query-projectEntities) API method. With this method, we can get all the project entities.

```graphql
query projectEntities($limit: Int = 20) {
  projectEntities(limit: $limit) {
    totalCount
    data {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
We can run the GraphQL query directly in the sandbox:

We should focus on the entities of `discussion_board` and `figure_inventory` because, as we stated earlier, we need to associate files with both entities.

### `graphqlRequest()`

GraphQL sandbox is perfect for application development because we can get the data result directly. Hence, we know how to process or integrate the data into the application. However, we can automate the GraphQL query in the application using ROQ's API `graphqlRequest()` for flexibility.
