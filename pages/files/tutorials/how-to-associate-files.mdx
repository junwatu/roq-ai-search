# How to Associate Files

The purpose of file associations is to relate files with entities and the technical benefit from it is to make a less complicated database schema.


## Get Entities

Before create any file associations we need to get the entities. We can do this using GraphQL query and ROQ's API `graphqlRequest()`.

    }
  }
}
```
