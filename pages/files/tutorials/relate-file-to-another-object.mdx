# Optional: Relate the file to another object

In most scenarios, a file belongs to some other object. For instance, an uploaded PDF file could be related to a `contract` object that exists in your project. Therefore, it is usually needed to link files to other objects.

There are two strategies to achieve this. In both cases, you must retrieve the file's ID and pass it to your server-side backend application. You can get the file's ID from the
[**`<FileUpload/>`**](/files/ui-components#fileupload) or [**`<FileDropzone/>`**](/files/ui-components#filedropzone) component using the `onUploadSuccess` handler.

1. You can add the file ID to your database tables (e.g., `roqFileId`). This way, you have full control over the relationships and can easily fetch and manipulate them. This works very well in the case of one-to-one relationships, but if an object is related to multiple files, you'll need to add additional tables just for the relation.

2. To keep your database schema clean, you can save the relation on the ROQ Platform side using the [createFileAssociation()](/files/api#createfileassociation) API.
