# Add the UI Component

ROQ ships with two UI Components which can be used to upload files:

1. The [**`<FileUpload/>`**](/files/ui-components#fileupload) component represents a button that opens a file selector and starts uploads.

2. The [**`<FileDropzone/>`**](/files/ui-components#filedropzone) UI component represents an area on your application where users can drag and drop files to be uploaded.

Please follow the respective instructions to integrate the UI component into your website. You'll need to pass the `key` of the previously created category as a prop.
