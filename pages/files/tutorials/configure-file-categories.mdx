### Configure File Categories

Each uploaded file belongs to a file category which you can configure in ROQ Console, go to the **File Handling** âž” **Categories** menu. File categories have two purposes:

* Fetch files by categories (e.g. _get all avatars_)
* Define max file size of uploaded files

You need to input a **key**, which you'll use when uploading the file.
