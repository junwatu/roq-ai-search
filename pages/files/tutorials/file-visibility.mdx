# File Visibility

## Set the visibility of the uploaded File

{/* TODO When you upload a new file, the visbility will be set to `public` by default.  */}

You can change the file's visibility using the [`makeFilePublic()`](/files/api#makefilepublic)
and [`makeFilePrivate()`](/files/api#makefileprivate) APIs.

Note that when you create a URL for download, this URL can still be shared with anonymous users. The main difference from a public file is that the URL will work only for a short period.
