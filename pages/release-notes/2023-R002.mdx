# Release Notes R002

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Released: 29 March 2023
</Callout>

## Highlights

* We migrated ROQ Platform to a more advanced hosting setup based on Kubernetes. Everything is running on
  [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/). The servers are located in Paris. This instance is called "Jupiter". Existing
  projects will be migrated by us during the next days. New projects are always using it.
* We also fixed some bugs related the the [Chat UI components](/chat/ui-components).

## Release instructions

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Don't update your project to the `1.0.0` versions of the NPM libraries as long as your project wasn't migrated to 
the Jupiter instance.
