# 🚀 New Onboarding Page in Console ✨

We are excited to announce the release of a new onboarding page in the 💻 console. This page is designed to help users get started with developing their generated applications further, quickly and efficiently 🚀.

Once an application is generated, users will receive an email with a link to the 🔗 console. Inside the console, they will see the onboarding page. The page has two main sections:

- Get the application code to run locally: This section provides instructions on how to ⬇️ download the application code and run it locally. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the application code and how it works.
- Continue building on top: This section provides instructions on how to 🏗 continue building on top of the application. This could include adding new API endpoints, modifying the database schema, or customizing the CRUD forms.

## ⭐️ Benefits:

The new onboarding page in the console provides a number of benefits, including:

- Quicker start: The onboarding page helps users get started with developing their generated applications more quickly 🚀.
- Reduced friction: The onboarding page reduces the friction of getting started with developing generated applications.
- Lower learning curve: The onboarding page helps users learn how to develop generated applications more easily.
