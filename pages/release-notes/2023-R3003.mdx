# ðŸ“¢ RELEASE UPDATE:  File upload feature added to the generated apps! ðŸš€

## We are thrilled to introduce File upload for your web application.

ðŸŽ¨ Now all the generated apps will be shipped with file upload functionality integrated and pre-configured out of the box. As a demonstration of the feature, we add file upload to your main entity - tenant. To try it out, you can generate an app, and check the main entity details page. You can add,delete and replace files for main entity from generated apps.
