# ðŸŽ‰ Introducing the New "Edit Data Model" Feature! ðŸŽ‰

We're excited to introduce our latest feature: the "Edit Data Model." This new tool is designed to make building your apps even better, easier, and more powerful.

## Why We Created the "Edit Data Model" Feature

We understand that you want to have full control over your apps. That's why we made this feature. We know that setting up the right data structure for your app can be like solving a puzzle. It can be tricky to fine-tune things perfectly. In the past, using Prisma to control your data was complicated. But now, with the "Edit Data Model" feature, we've made it simple. You can do it all through an easy-to-use interface in the console! ðŸŽ¨

## How to Use the "Edit Data Model" Feature

There are two ways to do it:

### Option 1:

* Log in to your console.
* Go to the app you want to change.
* On the onboarding page, you'll see a button called "Edit Data Model." Just click it. (@Vishal include a gif where to find the edit data model here. Visualize this flow with a gif.)


### Option 2:

* Log in to your app.
* Look for the "Edit Data Model" button at the top and click it. (@Vishal same here as above. Please visualize the flow with a gif for the user)


**Important Note**: If you make changes to your data model and then generate it, a new process will start. So, if your app was called "myapp," after making changes, you'll have "myapp" and "myappv2." Your previous version is saved, so you can fix mistakes if needed.

## What's Cool about the "Edit Data Model" Feature:

**Make Data Changes Easily**: Say goodbye to being stuck with one data setup. The "Edit Data Model" feature lets you change how your data looks without any trouble. You can customize your app's data structure just the way you want! ðŸ’ƒ

**Add Tables and Links with Ease**: Want to add a new table of data? Need to connect them? You got it!

**Manage Tables Smoothly**: Sometimes, you might want to get rid of sections you don't need anymore. "Edit Data Model" lets you do that. Stay efficient and flexible as your app evolves! ðŸŒŠ

**Edit Fearlessly**: Once you've set up your data, don't worry about making changes. "Edit Data Model" works well with different app versions. Each change you make becomes a new version of your app, like a history book of your progress! ðŸ“š
