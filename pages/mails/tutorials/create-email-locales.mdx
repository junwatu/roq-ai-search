# Create Email Locales

The email content supports any locales. By default, there are two locales supported: `English, United State en-US` and `Germany, de-DE`.

<Callout type="info">
To create additional locales to the application, please read this [documentation](/translations).
</Callout>

Depending on the first time you created an email template, there will be a list of localized templates. To create an email locale content, select any email template on the email template list and then click the `+ Create Localized Content` button.

You can customize each locale's content differently to suit your business needs. The content for the English locale could be different or just the same with the content from the German locale.
