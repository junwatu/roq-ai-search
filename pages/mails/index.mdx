# Transactional Mails

## Introduction

ROQ provides a unified way to send emails utilizing multiple providers like Sendgrid, Mandrill, Mailgun, and others. The email functionality is used by other features of ROQ, for instance confirming new user accounts.

This page describes how to send emails to someone using an email address. Please keep in mind that users cannot unsubscribe from transactional emails, and they are sent even when the user didn't confirm the email. If you want to notify a user instead, use ROQ's [notification feature](/notifications).
