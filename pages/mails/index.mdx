# Transactional Mails

## Introduction

ROQ provides a unified way to send emails utilizing multiple providers like Sendgrid, Mandrill, Mailgun, and
others. The email functionality is used by other features of ROQ, for instance confirming new user accounts.

This page describes how to send emails to someone using an email address. Please keep in mind that users cannot
unsubscribe from transactional emails, and they are sent even when the user didn't confirm the email. If you want to
notify a user instead, use ROQ's [notification feature](/notifications).

## How to send emails

To send emails via ROQ's API, you need to perform these steps:

### 1. Configure email provider

Make sure that an email provider is connected and activated. You will find a list of all integrations in [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/). To setup the integration go this [documentation](/mails/integration).

### 2. Create email template

Create a new email template and define a unique key. Then you can enter the content of the emails for each activated
locale. You can use placeholders for
any content you submit in the `data` parameter of the [sendMail API](/mails/api#sendmail).

```text
Hi {{firstName}}!
```

### 3. Send emails via API

Emails are sent using the [sendMail API](/mails/api#sendmail). You need to use the same key which you set to
the email type.
