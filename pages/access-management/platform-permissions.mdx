# Platform Permissions

Within the platform permissions settings, you can regulate access based on roles, or prevent a user with a specific role from accessing certain platform resources.

In addition to core features like user management, ROQ also provides numerous platform resources or features when generating a B2B SaaS application. The platform resources or features provided initially also depend on the selections made during the setup of the application in ROQ's AI generator. For instance, within the ROQ AI generator, you have the option to include a File & Chat system in the application being generated.

The ability for a specific role to access these add-on platform features is managed via the platform permissions setting.

Within the platform permissions section, you can grant and restrict access for a given role to a particular entity. You can also manage the operational permissions or access level for this entity, as well as define the scope of this access.

For example, to grant a role access to certain features within the chat system, such as:
- Initiating a conversation.
- Reading other chats within the same thread.
- Deleting chats.
- Adding or removing other users from the chat.

The platform permissions for the role would be set as follows:
