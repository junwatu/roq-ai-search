# Skip Authorization

During local development, if you need to ignore user permissions or access management rules, configure the `SKIP_AUTHORIZATION` environment variable to `true`. Add this environment variable to your `.env` file: 

Add this environment variable to the `.env` file:

```ini
SKIP_AUTHORIZATION=true
```
To illustrate the effects of modifying this environment variable, let's use the example of an organization named **Videoz**. 


**Videoz** is a B2B video-sharing platform that comprises two main roles: **Channel Owner** and **Content Creator**. At present, we have two users, each assigned a different role:

- One user is the **Channel Owner**.
- One user is the **Content Creator**.

TThe **Channel Owner** can view all videos, create new ones, delete any videos, and update only their videos. The access level and permissions for the **Channel Owner** are depicted below:

The **Content Creator**, on the other hand, can only view their videos, create a new video, delete their video, and update their video. The access level and permissions for the **Content Creator** are as follows:

![Content creator permissions](/content-creator-permissions.png)

When the environment variable `SKIP_AUTHORIZATION` is set to `false`, the video list varies according to the roles:

**Content Creator Video List**

The **Content Creator** can only see their videos, as the permissions for videos have been set to `Own`.`

**Channel Owner Video List**

Users assigned the **Channel Owner** role have access to all videos.

If we adjust the `SKIP_AUTHORIZATION` environment variable to `true`, all permissions settings will be ignored.

If you encounter difficulties observing the changes after altering permissions, consider halting the local development and then restarting it.

With this modification, the **Content Creator's** video list will display all videos, **regardless** of whether the permissions are set to `Own`.
