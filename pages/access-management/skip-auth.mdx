# Bypass Authorization

In local development, if you want to disregard user permissions or access management rules, you can configure the `SKIP_AUTHORIZATION` environment variable to `true`. Add this environment variable to the `.env` file:

```ini
SKIP_AUTHORIZATION=true
```
To explain the effects if we change this environment variable, we can show with a sample organization, **Videoz** 

## Videoz

**Videoz is a B2B video-sharing organization. This organization has 2 main roles **Channel Owner** and **Content Creator**. Currently, we have 2 users and each user has a different role:

- 1 user is the **Channel Owner**.
- 1 user is the **Content Creator**.

The user with the **Channel Owner** role can see all the videos, create a new video, delete any videos, and only can update their videos. The access level and the permissions for **Channel Owner** are as follows:

![channel owner permissions setup](/channel-owner-permissions.png)

The user with **Content Creator** can only see the user videos, create a new video, delete the user video, and update the user video. The access level and permissions for **Content-Creator** are as follows:

![Content creator permissions](/content-creator-permissions.png)

With the environment variable, `SKIP_AUTHORIZATION` set to `false` here is the list video for each role:

**Content Creator Video List**

The **Content Creator** role only can see the user's videos because we already setup the permission for Video is`Own`

**Channel Owner Video List**

Users with the **Channel Owner** role will have the privilege of all videos.

If we change the `SKIP_AUTHORIZATION` environment variable to `true` then all permissions settings will be ignored.


<Callout type="info">
If you have trouble seeing the changes after permissions modification, try to stop the local development and then start it again.
</Callout>

With this change, the **Content Creator** video list will display all the videos, **regardless** permissions is set to `Own`.
