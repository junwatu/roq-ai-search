# How to Protect Application Pages

## Next.js

<InstallROQNext/>

In the generated application rendering a specific react component is protected by the `withAuthorization()` method. This function is designed to handle access control in your application. It does this by checking if the current user has the required permissions to access a specific feature or resource before rendering the wrapped component.

Let's say we have a React component called `<CommentCreatePage/>` that's used for creating new comments:

```jsx
function CommentCreatePage() {
    return (
		// UI code is here
	)
}
```

and we need to ensure that this component can only be accessed by users who have the appropriate roles, access, and authorization.

```jsx
import { AccessOperationEnum, AccessServiceEnum, requireNextAuth, withAuthorization } from '@roq/nextjs';
import { compose } from 'lib/compose';

function CommentCreatePage() {
    return (
        //UI code is here
	)
}

export default compose(
  requireNextAuth({
    redirectTo: '/',
  }),
  withAuthorization({
    service: AccessServiceEnum.PROJECT,
    entity: 'comment',
    operation: AccessOperationEnum.CREATE,
  }),
)(CommentCreatePage);
```

The arguments passed to `withAuthorization()` include:

- `entity`: The entity on which the operation is being performed.
- `operation`: The type of operation being performed, which comes from the `AccessOperationEnum` (like `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc.).
- `service`: The service that this operation pertains to, which is part of the `AccessServiceEnum`.

The `CommentCreatePage` component is being wrapped with `withAuthorization()`. This means the user must have the **create** permission on the **comment** entity to access this page. If the user does not have the appropriate permissions, the user will be redirected to another route.

<Callout type="info">
The `compose()` is simply a utility code to compose functions. It calls `withAuthorization()` first and then moves on to `requireNextAuth()`.
