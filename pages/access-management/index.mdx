# Access Management

## Introduction

Access management in SaaS applications involves regulating who can access the application and what actions they are allowed to perform. This is accomplished through roles and permissions, which bestow varying levels of access to different users.

With ROQ's access management, you can:

* Define user roles such as admin, member, customer, and more.
* Establish roles and assign them to your users.
* Utilize these permissions to determine if a user is permitted to view specific content (e.g., buttons, pages) or execute a particular action (e.g., create an entity).
* Set permissions and apply them to the application.
* Filter data displayed within the application.

## The Big Picture

The entire system works in a coordinated manner to ensure seamless access management. Here's how all the components fit together:

In the ROQ Console, users configure roles and permissions. These are integral in defining user access rights and restrictions within the application.

Simultaneously, every database query within the project is supplemented with conditions derived from the user's roles and permissions. This means that each user's interaction with the database is customized based on their specific access rights, thereby ensuring a secure and controlled data environment.

To streamline the process and minimize manual intervention, the AI Assistant provides an auto-configuration feature. This advanced functionality allows for an automatic setup of roles and permissions based on predefined templates, significantly reducing the time and effort required in the initial configuration.

In essence, ROQ's access management combines the power of user-configured roles and permissions with an AI-driven automatic setup to deliver a robust, flexible, and efficient access management system.

## How It Works

Roles and permissions are defined in the [ROQ Console](https://console.roq.tech/). Generally, permissions grant access to objects, e.g., _a customer is allowed to make an order_. You can specify the operation (read, create, update, and delete) and set the scope. The scope determines if a user has access to either `all` records, only the `own` records, or to records related to the own account (~ `tenant`). These permissions are automatically enforced on all UI Components and APIs of ROQ and can also be applied to the project's user interface and queries.

*/}

Technically, the access management works based on a query plan which ROQ computes based on the current user's permissions and your database tables. The SDK is caching this information locally. This way, your application is independent of the availability of the ROQ Platform. Furthermore, there is no need to send all your data. ROQ only needs to know the schema of your database; the actual queries will be performed on your side.

{ /* You can use two functions of the SDK in your project: `hasAccess` and `buildQueryPlan`

## Check if a user has access to an object.

The `hasAccess` method returns `true` if a user has access to something; otherwise false.
You can use it for any object, whether it's an entity from your database, a URL, or a user interface component. See `hasAccess` SDK for more details.

## Filter Down Data of A Query

When you retrieve data from your database, you'll often need to filter it by the user's role. For example, let’s say you have a REST endpoint called `/rented-cars` which returns a list of rented cars. Depending on the user's role, the result will be different: an _admin_ will see all the rented cars, while a _customer_ will see only their rented cars. This can result in complicated WHERE conditions, especially if you have more than these two simple roles.

{ /*
For this scenario, ROQ provides a query builder that automatically creates the required conditions. Using our ORM adapter, this can be easily integrated into your project. The generated queries can become quite complex if you have a deep schema. You can read more details about this method here: `buildQueryPlan` SDK

## Roles, Permissions, and Scopes

### Roles

Roles are assigned directly to users. You can easily read them in sentences like this:

* User Mary is an **admin**
* User Jane is a **chef**
* User John is a **driver**
* User Richard is a **customer**

A **role** is represented by its name, such as **owner**, **member**, **manager**, **chef**, **driver**, or **customer**.

This [documentation](/access-management/roles) section explains more about roles on the ROQ Console. For a tutorial on how to assign or unassign roles from a user using ROQ's Node.js SDK API, read this [tutorial](/access-management/tutorials/user-roles-assignment).

### Permissions

**Permissions** determine the access level to a specific type of object. For instance, the role **manager** may be granted read access to the sales orders of a restaurant management application.

Permissions involve:

* The restricted entity (like `sales_order`),
* An operation (`read`, `create`, `update`, or `delete`),
* And a scope (`all`, `own`, or `tenant`).

#### Access Levels

To specify access levels for your application, select an object type (e.g., `salesOrder`). If the required object isn't available in the dropdown, it means it wasn't declared during the initial preparation.

For each object, you can set the following access levels:

| Level    | Description                                                 |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Read`   | Permits the user to retrieve objects         |
| `Create` | Allows the user to create new objects of the chosen type |
| `Update` | Enables the user to modify objects of the chosen type    |
| `Delete` | Authorizes the user to remove objects of the chosen type    |


### Scopes

**Scope** determines the range of access within the permission. Scope the access levels are defined similarly.

Scopes:

| Scope    | Description                                                               |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `All`    | Grants the user access to all records                        |
| `Own`    | Limits the access to records directly associated with the user    |
| `Tenant` | Restricts the access to records associated with the user's tenant or organization |
