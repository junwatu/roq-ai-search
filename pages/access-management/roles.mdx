# Roles

To manage user roles go to the ROQ console, **Users & Access** â†’ **Roles**. In this section you can create a role, edit role, and edit project permissions.

Roles are directly assigned to users, with each role being represented by a specific name. For instance, you may define roles such as **owner** and **member**. However, you can also be more precise and adopt terms that are relevant to your business context, such as **manager**, **chef**, **driver**, **marketing**, or **customer**.

## Create A Role

To generate a new user role, select the **+ Create A Role** button. For instance, if you want to create a **Marketing** role, you'll need to fill in the necessary fields: **Name** and **Key**. By default, this new role will have no platform permissions. Therefore, it is vital to assign the appropriate platform permissions to ensure the new role is usable.
