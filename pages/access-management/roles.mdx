# Roles

To manage user roles, navigate to the ROQ console and select **Users & Access** → **Roles**. This section allows you to create, modify, and adjust project permissions associated with roles.

Roles are explicitly linked to users and are represented by distinctive names. For example, you might designate roles such as **owner** and **member**. However, you can also refine your categorization using terms that directly correspond to your business context, like **manager**, **chef**, **driver**, **marketing**, or **customer**.

## Creating A Role

To create a new user role, click the **+ Create A Role** button. Suppose you aim to establish a **Marketing** role, you'll need to fill in the required fields: **Name** and **Key**. By default, this new role will lack any platform permissions. Consequently, it's essential to allocate the necessary platform permissions to make the new role functional.

## Editing A Role

To modify a role, click the **Edit Role** button (depicted by a keylock icon) located in the **Controls** section.

## Assigning or Unassigning a Role

Roles can only be assigned or unassigned within the **Users** console.To assign a role to a user, go to **Users & Access** → **Users** and then click the **Edit User** button (represented by a pen icon) in the **Controls** section.

To illustrate, if you wish to assign the **Marketing** role, choose this role from the *Assign a new role* drop-down menu.

Conversely, to unassign a role from a user, hover over the existing role and click the cross mark appearing next to the role.

## Defining Invited Roles

A role can invite another user associated with different roles. To specify which roles can be invited, navigate to **Users & Access** → **Roles**. Select a role, then click on **Edit Role** (represented by the keylock icon) → **Invite Roles**. From here, you can choose any other roles that can be invited.
